# Modern Firearms 3.0 Documentation and Guideline
Those Guidelines should be applied to Version 3.0 and following

## 1 Naming Rules
All EditorID's should get the prefix `MF_`.
That way they are easy to filter inside the creation kit.

## 2 OMOD Priorities
OMODs need proper priorities, so the effect of an OMOD with higher priority will overwrite one with lower priority.

The following list shows how Priorities should be set:
```
  0 - mods not listed below

 15 - Magazines
 30 - Ammo Conversions
 45 - Ammo Types
 60 - Suppressors
 75 - Underbarrel Weapons
 90 - Underbarrel Ammotypes

100 - Legendariy Modifications (we have to stay below)
```

## 3 Formlists
Scripted parts will be configured by setting up Formlists and/or Keywords

### 3.1 Toggle System

### 3.2 LL Injections
